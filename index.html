              <p>My business had some accounting issues that needed attention before I could file an accurate tax
                return, so I phoned Lynette. She responded quickly, and resolved the issues in a matter of days. She
                took the time to educate me on how to set up systems and processes to keep my business on track.</p>

              <p>We started getting threatening letters from the IRS for prior year tax returns that we did not realize
                we needed to file as we had been out of the country. Then we discovered significant mistakes on more
                recently filed returns made by another tax preparer. We hired Lynette to assist us in resolving our IRS
                problems. She keeps us updated regularly, and she is knowledgeable and detailed in her work. She is also
                helping us get our business records more organized so we can keep this from happening again. What a huge
                relief!</p>
